# The Parts of an Essay

While not all essays written for print are the same, they usually share similar parts:

* A Title
* An Author
* A description or abstract
* Sections
* Paragraphs
* Footnotes/Endnotes/References

All of these parts can be found in visual essays, but there are also additional elements:

* Images and Image Galleries
* Maps and Layers
* References that Connect to Linked Open Data
* Network Graphs

To make these new features possible, a visual essay relies on some level of coding that describes for readers what should appear on the screen at any given time. Our goal in creating the Visual Essay Tool has been to balance the performative possibilities of your essay with the complexity of code. In doing so, we have sought to make the technical hurdle of writing code as accessible as possible, preferring to hide messy details that are likely to be unproductive for authors and expose layers that could prove helpful for making visual arguments.

The structure of a visual essay is similar to a traditional printed essay with some key differences. First, it begins with a basic configuration tag that specifies the nature of the page/essay for the reader.

# The `param ve-config` Tag



The param ve-config tag is not technically required for an essay to render, but it supplies some crucial information that any serious essay is likely to include.
