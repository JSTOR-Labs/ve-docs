# Learn Markdown in 30 Minutes

Markdown is a simple way to format text. It allows you to mark text, so that it has basic formatting. In this short tutorial, we'll show you how to use markdown to do the following:

* Create Headers/Titles
* Add emphasis with italic and bold
* Create bulleted lists
* Create numbered lists
* Create hyperlinks
* Insert images
* Insert a horizontal rule/divider

# Viewing Your Writing in a Markdown Editor

In this quick lesson, we'll use a free online Markdown Editor called [Dillinger](http://dillinger.io). (You could also use another editor such as [StackEdit](http://stackedit.io) or [Editor.md](https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html). Whatever editor you choose, the editor will display the original text that you edit on the left and preview the transformed text (as it would appear in a web browser) on the right side. Select all the text in the Markdown box on the left and delete it so we can start with a fresh slate.

# Create Headers/Titles

A header is text that starts a new section, like a title. To create a large header, simply insert a hashtag (#) in front of the title. You can use additional hashtags for smaller headers. These are useful for creating sub-sections of a larger document. Try it in your editor!
