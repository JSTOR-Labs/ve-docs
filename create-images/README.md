* Link to a Hosted Image
* Upload an Image to your GitHub Repository

Generally, it is preferred to link to a hosted image instead of uploading an image to your GitHub Repository.

# Link to a Hosted Image (Preferred)

For most images, this is the best practice. Ideally, the image is hosted on a stable URL of some kind in a cultural heritage collection. Please include any information on Image Rights. If you have a copy of the image and the right to use it, you can also upload it to the [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Images) and link to it there.

# Upload an Image to your GitHub Repository** (Not Ideal)

This approach may make sense if you have an image whose rights are cleared, but that is not of general interest to the public (and therefore not appropriate for [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Images). This makes sense for small, site-specific images like navigation arrows or buttons. This may also be appropriate for properly sizing the banner for your site (or for a specific page). Keep in mind that GitHub does enforce limitations on repository (and therefore image) sizes, so any uploaded images should be small in size.
