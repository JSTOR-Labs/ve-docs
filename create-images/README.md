* Upload an Image to your Repository
* Adding External Images using the IIIF Tool

There are two approaches for adding images to your site:

**You can upload an image your repository**
Take this approach if you have a digital copy of the image and the rights to use it for your site. If you display an image in this fashion, your readers will not have access to specialized image tools such as zoom and image annotation. This approach should only be used for small images.

**You can link to an image hosted elsewhere**
Take this approach if you are linking to a high-resolution image from another source such as a cultural heritage institution. This will allow your users to zoom in and annotate the image.
