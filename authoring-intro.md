# An Introduction to the Visual Essay Tool

We have constructed a (very plain) visual essay site based on a single document: readme.md. We can see text in our readme.md rendered into a visual essay site based on a website visible at:

> http://visual-essay.app/your-github-username/your-repo-name

Each unique page in your site will be based on a single Markdown (.md) file. Using Markdown is a way to add basic formatting to each page, including emphasis, lists, and links. If you're not familiar with Markdown, we describe how to use it in the next section. Even if you have never coded before, you should be able to pick up the basics in about 30 minutes. If you've learned HTML before, you'll pick it up even faster.

Beyond Markdown, we'll show you how to add image annotations, maps, and linked open data to your essays. The combination of these elements will create a visual essay where your research can speak in new ways that are not impossible with traditional print media. 

* Interactive Image Annotation
* Video
* Information from Knowledge Graphs
* Interactive Maps with informational layers

These visualizations can be triggered automatically as readers scroll. They can also respond to user interactions. For example, if a location is mentioned in the text, a map could be automatically displayed to show the location. The user could manipulate the map to discover the relationship between locations.

If a person is mentioned in the text, more information (including images) can be sourced from outside experts and displayed automatically. This additional data is typically sourced from Wikidata (the knowledge base behind Wikipedia). Wikidata is a Linked Open Data (LOD) knowledge base containing nearly 80 million entities (as of Feb 2020) and growing at the rate of nearly 1 million per month.

Finally, maps can be added based on a latitude, longitude, and zoom level. Visual layers can also be overlaid on top of a map for historical images or alternative geographic representations.
