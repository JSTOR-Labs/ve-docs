# Viewing your Website Files on GitHub.com

The files for your website can be found in your github.com. To see them, log into your account at [GitHub.com](https://github.com). Then choose the repo you are currently working on. The address that shows the files in your repo will look like:
> http://github.com/your-user-name/your-repo-name

![GitHub files in a new repo](github-new-repo.png)

For now, you should just have a single file: README.md. The contents of the file will be displayed on the main page for your site at:
> http://visual-essays.app/your-user-name/your-repo-name

# Editing your Website Files on GitHub.com

If you edit the content of a file in your GitHub repository, it will be reflected (almost instantly) on your website. We can see this by changing our README.md file. To make changes, click on the pencil icon. (Alternatively, click on the "README.md" link first and then the pencil icon to edit.)
